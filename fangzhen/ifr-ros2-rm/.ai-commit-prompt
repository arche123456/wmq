This repository is primarily focused on machine vision and is built using ROS2 and C++. The file structure is organized as follows: `./[package]/[src|include|config|...]/...`. The scope should be centered around the package name. The actual code within the package is located in the `src` or `include` directories. Specifically, within the `include` directory: `./[package]/include/[package]/...` contains the package's own header files. If the second `[package]` position does not correspond to the package name, it indicates third-party library files.
